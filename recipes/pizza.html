    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A basic pizza dough recipe with minimal fuss</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons of yeast</li>
       <li>1 and 1/3 cups of water</li>
       <li>Flour</li>
       <li>Oil</li>
       <li>Salt</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
       <li>Cornmeal</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes.</li>
        <li>Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick sprayâ€”just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. </li>
        <li>Shape the dough: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half.</li>
        <li>Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare your pizza toppings.</li>
        <li>Top & bake the pizza: Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling.</li>
        <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.</li>
    </ol>
